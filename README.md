# Sepsis Classification Model ðŸš‘  

## Overview  
This repository contains a Python-based machine learning model for classifying and predicting the likelihood of sepsis. The project leverages advanced data science and machine learning techniques to assist in early detection and prevention of sepsis, using a dataset from **The Johns Hopkins University**.  

---

## Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, feature scaling, and outlier detection.  
- **Model Training**: Trains multiple machine learning models and evaluates their performance.  
- **Model Deployment**: A FastAPI application is provided for real-time prediction.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC analysis.  

---

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is provided by **The Johns Hopkins University**. It includes anonymized clinical data such as:  
- Demographic information  
- Vital signs  
- Laboratory test results  

Ensure proper authorization to access and use the dataset in compliance with relevant ethical guidelines.
